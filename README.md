# MENACE: Matchbox Educable Noughts And Crosses Engine üé≤‚ùå‚≠ï  

A Python reimplementation of Donald Michie‚Äôs **MENACE (1960s)** ‚Äî a physical matchbox machine that learned Tic-Tac-Toe using beads.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- MENACE agent with reinforcement learning (bead adjustment).
- Symmetry reduction (rotations/reflections).
- Training loop + visualization of win/draw/loss rates.
- Play interactively vs MENACE in the terminal.
- Unit tests included.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Morgan971-pixel/menace-tictactoe.git
cd menace-tictactoe
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

To train MENACE and see the learning curve:
```bash
menace-train
```

To play an interactive game against a trained MENACE in your terminal:
```bash
menace-play
```

## Historical Background

MENACE was originally created by **Donald Michie** in 1961 at Edinburgh University. Using 304 matchboxes and colored beads, Michie demonstrated that machine learning was possible without computers, decades before modern AI algorithms became practical.

### Key Historical Facts:
- **Inventor**: Donald Michie (1923-2007), British AI pioneer
- **Year**: 1961
- **Method**: 304 physical matchboxes containing colored beads
- **Learning**: Reinforcement through bead adjustment based on game outcomes
- **Impact**: Demonstrated feasibility of machine learning concepts
